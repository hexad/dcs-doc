# COCKPIT

## COCKPIT OVERVIEW

The AV-8B Night Attack version is equipped with a single-seat, elevated
cockpit. Compared to the older, “A” version, it contains two large multi-
purpose displays taken from the F/A-18, and an up-front control panel
mounted at the pedestal in front of the pilot.

To stay true to its name, this version of the Harrier also has several
adjustable flood lamps installed on both sides of the pit, as well as the
possibility to switch the backlighting of the instrument and side panels
to NVG mode.

![](img/img-046-167.jpg)

The night vision goggles are stored in a special bag on the aft part of
the right-hand panel. Installation of NVGs on the helmet (replacing the
visor) takes a few minutes, so make sure to plan the use of NVGs
accordingly!

on BRU-36 bomb racks, but retains AIM-9s
and / or AIM-122s on LAU-7 launchers on
stations 1 (1A) and 7 (7A). See Jettisson
Procedures section for more details. //link
2. Anti-Skid System Switch. This is an
electro-hydraulic system that controls
hydraulic pressure to the brakes and
provides full skid protection at speeds
above 16 knots and partial protection at
speeds between 8 and 16 knots. It has three positions:

    - Test: allows the pilot to check the system. The system will not work if
    the parking brake is engaged or if the essential 28 volt DC power is lost.
    - ON: activates the system. See XXX section for more information.
    - NWS: deactivates the anti-skid system but allows for tighter turns and
    manoeuvres when taxiing. When the switch is in this position, the Skid
    light on the Caution Lights Panel should illuminate. See XXX section for
    more information.

3. Flaps BIT Switch. Used to perform the pilot-initiated built-in-test of
flaps (IBIT). In order to to do so, set the Flap Power Switch (6) to ON
and press the BIT Switch. FLAPS 1, FLAPS 2 and AUT FLAP caution
lights and FLAPS warning light will illuminate FLAPS 1, FLAPS 2 and
AUT FLAP caution lights and FLAPS warning light will illuminate. The
flaps will then cycle up and down, and can be monitored by watching
the flap indicator (7) on the landing gear control panel and in the
HUD, when the V/STOL master mode is selected. Once all movement of
the flaps has stopped, place the Flaps Mode Switch (8) to the STOL
position and verify both STO and DROOP lights are illuminated. To
finish the check, place the Flaps Mode Switch (8) to the CRUISE
position.
4. Down Lock Override Button. Pressing it disables the mechanical
down lock stop and allows the pilot to set the Landing Gear Handle to
the UP position even with the weight on the main landing gear.

    - RESET: Momentary switch. When used, it resets the Flaps Controller
    logic and cancels an initiated BIT.

7. Left flap position indicator. Shows the current position of the flaps
in degrees (between 00 and 98).
8. Flaps Mode Switch. This 3-position switch controls the position of
the flaps and aileron droop depending on the current airspeed.

    - STOL: used for takeoff and landing. Provides 25° of flaps and 0°
    aileron droop when the airspeed is over 165 knots and between 25°-62°
    of flaps and 15° aileron droop if the airspeed is below 165 knots and
    the nozzles are moved greater than 25° (flap angle is variable based on
    nozzle angle to prevent burning the flaps with the hot nozzles).
    - AUTO: with the landing gear up and depending on the airspeed, Mach
    number and angle-of-attack, the flaps will be scheduled between 0 and
    25° with 0° of aileron droop. When the landing gear is down, provides
    5° of flaps and 0° of aileron droop.
    - CRUISE: provides 25O of flaps and 0° of aileron droop.

    !!! hint
        More information can be found in the TRAINING MISSION 1 (cockpit
        familiarisation), 2 (starting from cold & dark) and 3-6 (covering different

the mission computer (when aircraft is in A/A or A/G master mode). In
RUN, the recorder will run continously, regardless of aircraft master
mode.
4. :octicons-x-circle-16:{ title="NOT FUNCTIONAL: this feature is currently not implemented in this module" } **VRS Display Select Switch.** The two-position switch selects the
applicable output video display formats:
    - DDI Selects video that is displayed (MPCD) on the DDI/MPCD. The
output video is sent to the recorder.
    - HUD When HUD is selected, only head-up display video can be
recorded, including the symbology superimposed on the HUD field-
of-view.
5. **DMT Power Switch:** The DMT power switch is a two-position switch
located on the miscellaneous control panel. The up position (DMT)
applies power to the DMT unit. The down position (OFF) removes
power. When the switch is in the off position, the DMT gimbals are not
caged and instead relies on balance and soft stops for sensor protection.
It is desirable to keep the DMT on during aircraft operation for better
sensor protection although it is not a requirement.
6. **DP Switch.** Controls selection of mutually redundant display
channels in the display computer. The display computer drives the HUD
and DDI, providing display redundancy for attack, navigation, and
approach to landing.
    - PRIM position selects a primary display channel for operation.
    - ALTER position selects an alternate display channel for operation.
    - AUTO position, which is the preferred switch position, randomly
selects the operational channel for operation and provides
automatic reselection if there is a display computer channel failure.
7. **Probe Heat Switch.** Controls power to the left and right pitot static
probes, the total temperature probe, the case and probe heater of the
angle of attack probe, and the DECS total temperature probes.
    - AUTO With weight on wheels, power is removed from all heaters
except AOA case heater. With aircraft airborne, all probe heaters
receive power.
    - PRB With weight on wheels, all HT heaters are energised but the
left and right pitot static probes are energised at reduced power.
With aircraft airborne, all probe heaters receive power same as
AUTO. The switch is magnetically held in the PRB HT position.
When power is removed, the switch drops into the AUTO position.
8. :octicons-x-circle-16:{ title="NOT FUNCTIONAL: this feature is currently not implemented in this module" } **Mission Computer Switch.** It has three positions:
    - OVRD (override): inhibits the backup mode of operation. If in the
backup mode at the time of placing the switch to OVRD, this allows
power to be reapplied to the mission computer, enabling it to operate
normally.
    - OFF: turns off the mission computer and enables the display
computer for backup mode of operation.
    - AUTO: mission computer will be normally utilized, but the system
automatically reverts to the display computer in case of MC failure.

    - INT: Fuel remaining in internal tanks of respective feed group is
displayed.
    - WING: Fuel remaining in respective internal wing tank is displayed.
    - INBD: Fuel remaining in respective inboard external tank is displayed.
    - OUTBD: Fuel remaining in respective outboard external tank is
displayed.

!!! info
    The fuel quantity selector switch should be placed to the position that best
    describes the aircraft state. If external tanks are used, the TOT position
    will present the most accurate fuel indication. With internal fuel only, the
    INT position is more accurate and should be used. When aircraft total fuel
    is below 750 pounds, the FEED position will most accurately indicate the
    fuel remaining in the respective center feed tank.

### BRAKE / HYDRAULIC PRESSURE INDICATOR

![](img/img-073-342.jpg)

1. **Brake and Hydraulic Pressure Indicators.** Consists of three drum - type

hydraulic system demands.
2. **Brake Accumulator Usable Pressure.**
range is 3000 to 1000 psi. When
accumulator pressure drops below 1000 psi,
braking power is lost. If excessive brake
heating occurs in a main wheel, three
fusible plugs are provided to deflate the tire.

### CAUTION / ADVISORY LIGHT PANEL

All caution lights indicate the existence of an impending dangerous
condition requiring attention, but not necessarily immediate action. The
green advisory lights indicate safe or normal configuration, condition of
performance, operation of essential equipment, or information for
routine purposes. The advisory lights are on the caution/advisory light
panel and on various other panels throughout the cockpit. More details
on each light may be found in description of relevant systems.

### COCKPIT ALTIMETER

![](img/img-075-358.jpg)

Cockpit altimeter is mounted
to the right of the caution
light panel on the main
instrument panel (see
cockpit, foldout section) and
indicates cockpit pressure
altitude from 0 to 50,000
feet.

Between altitudes of 8,000
feet to 23,000 feet the system
maintains a constant cockpit
pressure altitude of 8,000
feet. At altitudes above
23,000 feet, the cockpit
pressure regulator maintains a constant 5 psi pressure differential
greater then ambient pressure.

### THREAT ADVISORY LIGHTS

![](img/img-075-362.jpg)

Threat warning lights indicate when the aircraft is
under threat from enemy radars.

1. **SAM.** SAM launch detected.
2. **CW.** Ground tracking (Continuous Wave) radar
is locked on aircraft.
3. **AI.** Air intercept radar is locked on aircraft.
Flashes if launch is detected (radar is guiding a
missile)
4. **AAA.** Anti Aircraft Artillery gun radar is locked
on aircraft.

### REAL PANEL LEFT

![](img/img-077-376.jpg)



1. **DECS Enable Switch.** DECS stands for Digital Engine Control
System - which provides engine control throughout the engine
operating range in response to throttle position, altitude, airspeed,
AOA, inlet air temperature, and aircraft configuration.
2. **Fuel Shutoff Handle.** When the handle is OFF, the aircraft fuel
system is isolated from the engine and the fuel flow proportioner is shut
off. The handle can be moved down to the ON position where it will be
locked. To put it back up, a button on the end of the handle has to be
pressed (note: there is no default keybind assigned to it).


### PILOT SERVICES PANEL


![](img/img-078-384.jpg)


1. **Engine Fuel Control Switch.** Responsible for choosing which DECU
(Digital Electronic Control Unit) will be controlling the engine at any
given time. POS 1 selects DECU 1, POS 2 selects DECU 2. Each DECU is
capable of full control over the engine and one will take over in case
the other fails. This happens automatically, but pilot’s control over the
lane which is used could be helpful in resetting the failed DECU
processing erroneous data. In case of loss of power to either DECU, [[EFC]]{ color=yellow }
caution and [[JPTL]]{ color=red } warning lights will illuminate.
2. **Engine RPM Select Switch.** Used to switch the data displayed on a
tachometer between compressor (HI) and fan (LOW) rpm on the EDP.
3. **LIDS Switch.** Responsible for operating the LIDS - Lift Improvement
Device System. The LIDS, composed of fixed strakes and a retractable
fence, increase the vertical lift 1200 pounds by directing the jet
fountain energy and reducing hot air reingestion in ground effects. It
has two positions:

    - **RET:** retracts LIDS fence.
    - **NORM:** LIDS fence operates normally.

4. **Oxygen Switch.** Turns ON and OFF the OBOGS (On-Board Oxygen
Generating System), providing continuously available supply of
breathing gas for the pilot while the aircraft’s engine is operating.
5. **Water Dump Switch.** Used to dump water from the 500 pound tank
containing distilled or demineralized water and located in the engine
bay. It has two positions:

taxi light. To operate, it does not need the exterior lights master switch
to be on.

### FUEL PANEL


![](img/img-081-404.jpg)


1. **Air Refuelling (A/R) Switch.** The switch is lever-locked and has
positions of IN, OUT and PRESS.

    - **IN:** Retracts the probe and pressurizes the tanks.
    - **OUT:** stops pressurization to the tanks and extends A/R probe. After
contact is made and refueling begins, the tanks depressurize.
    - **PRESS:** Leaves the probe extended and pressurizes the tanks.

2. **Fuel Flow Proportioner Switch.** The function of the fuel flow
proportioner is to equalize the flow of fuel from the two feed groups.
This switch provides a means of shutting off the proportioner if a fuel
out of balance correction is needed.
3. **Boost Pump Switches.** These switches operate the four boost
pumps, two in each of the feed tanks. The ac driven pumps (NORM)
only operate with the main generator online or external electrical
power applied. The dc driven pumps will operate with external power,
main generator, emergency generator, or battery. They can be used in
conjunction with the PROP switch to correct a fuel imbalance by
turning OFF the low side.
4. **Wing Fuel Dump Switches.** External and internal wing fuel may be
dumped in flight by selecting the DUMP position on the wing fuel dump
switches. There are two electro-magnetically held switches, on the left
console, marked L (left) and R (right). Both switches may be used
simultaneously in order to reduce gross weight, or individually when
pilot wants to correct out of balance conditions.

Fuel will continue to dump until the internal wing tanks are empty, the
switches are placed to NORM or if fuel setting in the BINGO window
equals the remaining total fuel.

### MISCELLANEOUS SWITCH PANEL

![](img/img-083-416.jpg)



1. **External Lights Master Switch.** Provides a master control for the
following lights: position lights, formation lights, anti-collision lights,
landing/taxi lights, sideslip vane lights, and the air refueling probe
light. It has three positions:

    - **OFF:** power for all lights controlled by this switch is set to off.
    - **NVG:** power available for Anti-Collision Lights and Formation lights in
the NVG (covert) mode. This means they won’t be visible for someone
not equipped with the NVGs.
    - **NORM:** power for all lights controlled by this switch is set to ON.

2. **Seat Adjustment Switch.** Allow to bring the seat up or down for
better outside visibility from the cockpit.

throttles. Moreover, during INS alignment, Parking Brake has to be in
AFT (engaged) position for the process to begin / continue.
10. **Jet Pipe Temperature Limiter (JPTL) Switch.** When set to OFF, it
mutes the DECS JPT limits. The acceleration limit is retained and AOA
cutback is not retained. In addition, the fan speed schedule is reset to
the short lift wet schedule and limit. This results in a 6.0 to 7.0% rpm
increase.
11. **Manual Fuel Switch (MFS).** This switch has three positions:

    - **ON (forward):** Engine control is transferred from DECS to MFS
    - **Neutral (center):** neutral position.
    - **OFF (back):** Engine control is transferred from MFS to DECS.

    The MFS provides an alternate means of engine control if the primary
fuel control system fails. Engine handling and relighting are adequate
for emergency recovery. With MFS control the engine response is more
sensitive to throttle movement because the MFS does not contain any
automatic acceleration controls or limiters. The engine ignitors
continually pop as long as MFS is selected.

### STABILITY AUGMENTATION & ATTITUDE HOLD SYSTEM (SAAHS) PANEL

### EMERGENCY RESTRAINT RELEASE

![](img/img-096-500.jpg)



This handle does NOT eject the pilot from the airplane. It is used for
ground emergency escape or emergency crew removal, in case the pilot
is unconscious. What it does is, it cuts the leg restraints that are
connected to the pilot’s G-suit behind their calves. When the pilot is
ejected, those leg restraints pull the pilot’s legs in toward the seat so
they are not injured during ejection. If a pilot had a ground emergency
and didn’t want to reach down to disconnect his/her leg restraints, they
could squeeze the handle and pull up to cut them off, making a ground
egress much quicker.
